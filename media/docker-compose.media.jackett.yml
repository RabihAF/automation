# Jackett works as a proxy server: 
# it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, etc) 
# into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, 
# then sends results back to the requesting software. 
# This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. 
# Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & 
# translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.
